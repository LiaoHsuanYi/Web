### Web Development Final Project: Hotel Booking Website
This project is a hotel booking site. First, execute the app.py file, and it will get a virtual link.  
Upon visiting the site, the first page displayed is the sign-up page. The second page is similar, but it's intended for user login.  
   
Once logged in, users can book their desired rooms, and they will have the opportunity to verify their booking information again.  
  
Administrators can access the booking list by logging in with the account and password "admin." After successful login, they will be redirected to the administrator dashboard, where they can view and manage all bookings.
